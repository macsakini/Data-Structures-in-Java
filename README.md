# Data-Structures-in-Java
This is a collection of some of the most fundamental data structures done in Java.

Each file in this repository is a snippet of the java function assigned. The name of the repository is also closely related to the task at hand.
i.e getset.java includes getters and setters.

An example includes
```java
public static void main(String[] args){
        int a, b, c;
        a = 1;
        b = 2;
        c = 3;

        HashMap<String,Integer> happy = new HashMap<>();

        happy.put("a", a);
        happy.put("b", b);
        happy.put("c",c);


        System.out.println(happy.get("c"));
}
)
```
